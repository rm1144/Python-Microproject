Spock Lizard Scissors game using python

Introduction:
Spock, Lizard, Scissors is a zero-sum hand game that is played around the world with
many different names and variations. It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions
and in some cases it is even played for sport. It is usually played between two people, in
which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
These shapes are &quot;Spock&quot; (Star Trek Vulcan salute),&quot;Lizard&quot; (sock-puppet- like mouth), and
&quot;Scissors&quot; (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has only
three possible outcomes other than a tie.

				This game is used:
		[1] To have a quick game to settle disputes.
		[2] To determine an order for doing something.
		[3] To enter a tournament
		[4] To play for fun

On the startup of the game, the computer asks the user which option the user likes to
select. The user has to provide with one of the option provided and press return key
(enter button). The program then shows the selection by the user and also the selection
by the computer which later processes the score. There is also an option to exit the
game in between. If the user exits the game in the middle the score he/she got will be
shown at the last.
